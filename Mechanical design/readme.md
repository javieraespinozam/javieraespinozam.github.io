## 1. Gear Box Design — Technical Drawing

### Overview
This project presents a **gearbox assembly** designed and modeled in **Autodesk Inventor**, illustrating the mechanical layout, key dimensions, and assembly views for the transmission system.  
The PDF includes orthographic projections and section views used to validate clearances, gear alignment, and housing geometry.

### Contents
- **Assembly Drawing:** Exploded and assembled views of the gearbox  
- **Component Dimensions:** Detailed measurements for shafts, bearings, gears, and housing  
- **Bill of Materials (BOM):** Reference parts included in the mechanical system  
- **Tolerances and Annotations:** Machining and fit information aligned with manufacturing standards

### Design Objective
The gearbox is designed to **transmit mechanical power efficiently** between rotating shafts under variable load conditions.  
The design emphasizes:
- Torque transmission efficiency  
- Compactness and ease of assembly  
- Material optimization for lightweight yet durable performance  
- Compatibility with standard gear module specifications

### Tools and Methods
- **Software:** Autodesk Inventor (modeling and drawing)  
- **File Format:** PDF export from `.iam` / `.idw` assembly  
- **Analysis:** Preliminary kinematic and structural verification using CAD parameters

### How to View
To explore the model interactively:
- Upload the `.iam` or `.ipt` files to [Autodesk Viewer](https://viewer.autodesk.com/)  
- Or open with CAD-compatible software such as **Fusion 360**, **FreeCAD**, or **Solid Edge Viewer**

## 2. Mechanical Design — Medium Power Wind Turbine (3 MW)

### Overview
The **Mechanical Design Final Report (MEC388)** focuses on the conceptual and structural design of a **3 MW wind turbine** for deployment in a high-wind zone near **Antofagasta, Chile**.  
The project, supervised by **Mag. Ing. René Valdenegro Oyaneder**, integrates mechanical design, power transmission, lubrication, control systems, and manufacturability.

### Objectives
- Design a **horizontal-axis wind turbine** with optimal aerodynamic and structural performance  
- Evaluate and select design alternatives based on complexity, reliability, cost, and environmental impact  
- Dimension key components: **tower, rotor, blades, shaft, and nacelle (gondola)**  
- Develop lubrication, maintenance, and safety systems ensuring long-term operation  
- Deliver CAD-based assemblies and engineering drawings for fabrication

### Key Specifications
- **Rated Power:** 3 MW  
- **Tower Height:** 95 m  
- **Blade Length:** 78 m  
- **Expected Service Life:** 25 years  
- **Operating Wind Range:** 4–25 m/s  
- **CO₂ Reduction:** ≈ 8570 tons/year avoided emissions  
- **Lubrication System:** SKF Multiline (synthetic PAO oil)  
- **Generator:** Permanent magnet synchronous, direct-drive  

### Structural Components
- **Rotor:** Curved three-blade configuration made of fiberglass and resin composite  
- **Tower:** Hybrid concrete–steel tubular structure (95 m)  
- **Shaft:** AISI 4340 steel, 5 m long and 1.5 m in diameter  
- **Nacelle:** Fiberglass housing containing the generator and control systems  
- **Braking and Control:** Hydraulic brake (HAB-4-90RS) and Radio Bridge sensors for predictive maintenance

### Calculations and Modeling
- Aerodynamic power derived from **Betz’s limit** (η ≈ 0.59)  
- Realistic efficiency target of **40%**, yielding approximately **3.4 MW** of effective power  
- 3D modeling and assembly completed in **Autodesk Inventor**  
- Detailed **Free Body Diagrams (FBDs)**, centroid, and mass calculations for each component

### Deliverables
- Complete **engineering report** with design rationale, diagrams, and safety considerations  
- **Drawings and assembly views** for the tower, rotor, nacelle, shaft, and blades  
- **Maintenance and operations manual** outlining predictive, preventive, and corrective maintenance procedures
