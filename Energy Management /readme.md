## Overview

This project, developed in collaboration with **Akademiska Hus**, presents a long-term **energy optimization plan for Umeå University** under the *Campus Vision 2050* initiative.  
The main goal is to achieve a **net-zero campus** by 2050 through data-driven modeling, system mapping, and scenario evaluation across energy, biodiversity, transport, and waste systems.

The study combines **building-level simulations (IDA ICE)** and **energy system optimization (Homer Pro)** to evaluate three strategic development scenarios:
1. **Sunlight Symphony** – Business-as-usual case with building renovation and expanded solar PV.
2. **Forest Harmony** – Integration of biomass and biodigester systems.
3. **Nordic Breeze** – Increased use of heat pumps coupled with renewable electricity.

---

## Objectives

- Analyze the current energy performance of **Umeå University** and propose sustainable pathways to 2050.  
- Quantify the potential for **renewable integration** (solar PV, biomass, heat pumps).  
- Reduce **energy demand**, **carbon intensity**, and **external energy dependence**.  
- Evaluate **economic and environmental trade-offs** across three modeled scenarios.

---

## Methodology

### 1. Data Collection and Modeling
- Input data were obtained from **Akademiska Hus** (33 buildings) including heating, electricity, and cooling use.  
- Building archetypes were modeled in **IDA ICE** to estimate energy demand and system performance.  
- Supply-side modeling and optimization were executed in **Homer Pro** using IDA ICE outputs.

### 2. Tools and Frameworks
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| **IDA ICE** | Dynamic building simulation (heating, cooling, energy balance). |
| **Homer Pro** | Energy system optimization and scenario evaluation. |
| **Excel** | Data formatting and extrapolation across 33 buildings. |

### 3. Assessment Phases
1. **System Mapping** – Definition of energy, built environment, transport, and biodiversity flows.  
2. **Scenario Ideation** – Development of future projections and key assumptions (population, solar capacity).  
3. **Quantitative Modeling** – Simulation of energy and emissions in 2030–2050 horizons.  
4. **Economic & Sensitivity Analysis** – Evaluation of financial indicators (NPV, IRR, ROI, DPP) and parameter variation.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

| KPI | Definition | Unit | Goal |
|-----|-------------|------|------|
| **Energy Demand Reduction** | Optimize use of existing buildings and reduce consumption intensity. | kWh/m² | ↓ 20% by 2050 |
| **Carbon Intensity** | Decrease CO₂ emissions from energy supply. | gCO₂eq/kWh | ↓ 50% by 2050 |
| **Local Energy Production** | Increase share of on-site renewable generation. | kWh(Produced)/kWh(Used) | ≥ 25% by 2050 |

## Scenario Summaries

### 🌞 **Scenario 1 – Sunlight Symphony**
- *Baseline renovation & PV expansion (1 MW by 2050)*  
- Improvements in building insulation and lighting efficiency.  
- **Focus:** Demand-side efficiency.  
- **Findings:** Limited impact on energy demand due to existing high insulation levels.

### 🌲 **Scenario 2 – Forest Harmony**
- Adds **biodigester and 100 kW biogenerator** utilizing campus biomass and green waste.  
- Expands green areas for biomass yield.  
- **Focus:** Local renewable generation.  
- **Findings:** Increases local self-sufficiency but raises on-campus CO₂ emissions.

### ❄️ **Scenario 3 – Nordic Breeze**
- Expands **heat pump capacity** from 1.8 MW to 2.6 MW.  
- Coupled with 100% renewable electricity from Umeå Energi.  
- **Focus:** Electrification and decarbonization.  
- **Findings:** Best performance across all KPIs — lowest emissions, fastest payback.

## Results

### Energy Demand
- Campus energy demand reduced **without new buildings**, using improved occupancy and scheduling.  
- Heat pump implementation showed the **largest efficiency gain** (COP ≈ 4).  

### Carbon Intensity
- **Nordic Breeze** achieved the lowest carbon intensity (~2 gCO₂eq/kWh) by replacing district heating with electric heat pumps.  

### Economic Viability
| Scenario | NPV (kr) | ROI (%) | IRR (%) | DPP (years) |
|-----------|-----------|---------|----------|--------------|
| Sunlight Symphony | 738,506,572 | 3.7 | 5.5 | 12.8 |
| Forest Harmony | 706,230,115 | 9.0 | 12.0 | 9.7 |
| **Nordic Breeze** | **691,187,546** | **9.9** | **8.4** | **6.5** |

**Conclusion:** *Nordic Breeze* demonstrates the best balance of energy, emissions, and economic performance.

## Business Model Innovation

A **biochar production and circular economy model** was proposed:
- Utilize **campus biomass waste** (food, paper, green waste) via pyrolysis.  
- Create **biochar** for sustainable agriculture and carbon sequestration.  
- Partner with local food providers to reinforce circular economy practices.

---

## Recommendations

- Expand **heat pump infrastructure** to meet future heating and cooling loads.  
- Maintain **LED and smart systems** for lighting and IT equipment.  
- Optimize **space utilization** to avoid new construction.  
- Develop **on-site biomass and biochar programs** to enhance self-sufficiency.
