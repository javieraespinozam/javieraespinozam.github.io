## 1. Desalination Plant in the Valparaíso Region

### Overview
This project, developed for **MEC385 — Environmental Engineering** under **Professor Andrés Arriagada**, proposes the design and environmental assessment of a **seawater desalination plant** for the city of **Ventanas, Puchuncaví**, in the **Valparaíso Region, Chile**.  
The study analyzes the technical feasibility, environmental impacts, and legislative compliance for a plant designed to mitigate the severe **megadrought** affecting central Chile.

### Key Highlights
- **Process:** Reverse osmosis desalination system producing **1000 L/s** of potable water  
- **Company:** Aguas Pacífico SpA  
- **Investment:** 162 million USD  
- **Location:** Fundo El Carrizo, Ventanas, Puchuncaví  
- **Salinity Management:** Brine discharge of 1.36 m³/s with 72.3 psu  
- **Sectors:**  
  - Maritime Works (intake and outfall system)  
  - Land Transmission & Electrical Line  
  - Desalination and Post-treatment Plant  
  - Aqueduct and Distribution System  

### Environmental and Legislative Analysis
- Evaluates **flora, fauna, air, soil, and noise pollution** during construction and operation.  
- Details compliance with **Chilean environmental law (SEIA, DS 90/2000, DS 40/2012)**.  
- Includes mitigation and contingency plans for marine ecosystems.  

### Energy and Optimization
- Explores **renewable energy integration** through solar, wind, and tidal sources.  
- Discusses **brine management** and **process optimization** for sustainability.  

### Results and Conclusions
- The desalination plant effectively addresses the **regional water deficit** while aligning with sustainability goals.  
- Key impacts identified in marine flora/fauna were mitigated through **species relocation and continuous monitoring**.  
- The report supports desalination as a **viable adaptation measure** to Chile’s megadrought.

## 2. Project Kolwara — Energy Storage and Sale

### Overview
Developed for **MEC381 — Mechanical Engineering Project**, **Project Kolwara** (Aymara for *“water”*) proposes a **pumped-storage hydropower (PSH)** plant that stores and sells energy by exploiting **hourly electricity price fluctuations** in the Chilean power market.  
The project promotes **renewable energy integration**, grid stability, and long-term economic viability.

### Objectives
- Store electrical energy during low-price periods (high renewable generation).  
- Generate and sell electricity during high-demand hours (“peak periods”).  
- Support the efficiency of the **Chilean Central Interconnected System (SIC)**.  
- Encourage the use and economic feasibility of **non-conventional renewable energy sources (NCRE)**.

### Technical Highlights
- **Technology Chosen:** Pumped-Storage Hydropower (PSH)  
- **Installed Capacity:** 250 MW  
- **Head:** 450 m  
- **Operation:** 8 hours pumping / 8 hours generation per day  
- **Reservoir:** 2 Gl of seawater at 1,800 m from the coast  
- **Turbines:** Two reversible Francis turbines (159 MW each)  
- **Pipeline:** Dual 3.64 m conduits, above-ground installation  

### Economic and Technical Evaluation
- **Investment (CAPEX):** 397 million USD  
- **Annual Revenue:** 82.5 million USD  
- **Annual OPEX:** 26.8 million USD  
- **Net Present Value (NPV):** 272 million USD  
- **Internal Rate of Return (IRR):** 11.2%  
- **Payback Period:** 9 years  
- **Evaluation Horizon:** 40 years, 6% discount rate  

### Results
- **Technically and economically viable** for Chile’s renewable energy market.  
- Provides **energy flexibility** and supports **grid stability** during peak hours.  
- Fosters **sustainable energy policy** and contributes to national decarbonization targets.
