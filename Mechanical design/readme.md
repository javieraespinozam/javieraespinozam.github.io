# Academic Engineering and Astronomy Projects — UTFSM

This repository compiles major university projects completed by **Javiera Espinoza Morales** at the **Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María (UTFSM)** between 2022–2023.  
It includes detailed technical reports and computational analyses across three domains:
- **Mechanical Design and Renewable Energy Systems**
- **Astronomical Spectral Analysis using IRAF**
- **Aperture Photometry using APT**

Each project demonstrates applied engineering design, simulation, and data processing within both mechanical and astronomical contexts.

# Gear Box Design — Technical Drawing

## Overview
This document presents a gearbox assembly designed and modeled in **Autodesk Inventor**, illustrating the mechanical layout, key dimensions, and assembly views for the transmission system.  
The PDF contains orthographic projections and section views used to validate clearances, gear alignment, and housing geometry.

## Contents
- Assembly Drawing: Exploded and assembled views of the gearbox  
- Component Dimensions: Detailed measurements for shafts, bearings, gears, and housing  
- Bill of Materials (BOM): Reference parts included in the mechanical system  
- Tolerances and Annotations: Machining and fit information aligned with standard manufacturing practices

## Design Objective
The gearbox is intended to **transmit mechanical power efficiently** between rotating shafts under variable load conditions.  
The design focuses on:
- Torque transmission efficiency  
- Compactness and ease of assembly  
- Material optimization for lightweight yet durable performance  
- Compatibility with standard gear module specifications

## Tools and Methods
- Software: Autodesk Inventor (modeling and drawing)
- File Format: PDF export of `.iam` / `.idw` mechanical assembly
- Analysis: Preliminary kinematic and structural verification using CAD parameters

## How to View
To explore the model interactively:
- Upload the `.iam` or `.ipt` files to [Autodesk Viewer](https://viewer.autodesk.com/)
- Or open with CAD-compatible software such as **Fusion 360**, **FreeCAD**, or **Solid Edge Viewer**


## 2. Mechanical Design — Medium Power Wind Turbine (3 MW)

### Overview
The **Mechanical Design Final Report (MEC388)** focuses on the conceptual and structural design of a **3 MW wind turbine** intended for deployment in a high-wind zone near **Antofagasta, Chile**.  
The project was developed under the supervision of **Mag. Ing. René Valdenegro Oyaneder** and integrates mechanical design, power transmission, lubrication, control systems, and manufacturability.

### Objectives
- Design a **horizontal-axis wind turbine** with optimal aerodynamic and structural performance.  
- Evaluate and select between competing design alternatives based on complexity, reliability, cost, and environmental impact.  
- Dimension key components: **tower, rotor, blades, shaft, nacelle (gondola)**.  
- Develop lubrication, maintenance, and safety systems ensuring long-term operation.  
- Deliver CAD-based assemblies and engineering drawings for fabrication.

### Key Specifications
- **Rated Power:** 3 MW  
- **Tower Height:** 95 m  
- **Blade Length:** 78 m  
- **Expected Service Life:** 25 years  
- **Operating Wind Range:** 4–25 m/s  
- **CO₂ Reduction:** ≈ 8570 tons/year avoided emissions  
- **Lubrication System:** SKF Multiline (synthetic PAO oil)  
- **Generator:** Permanent magnet synchronous, direct-drive  

### Structural Components
- **Rotor:** Curved three-blade configuration, fiber glass with resin composite.  
- **Tower:** Hybrid concrete–steel tubular design (95 m).  
- **Shaft:** AISI 4340 steel, 5 m long, 1.5 m diameter.  
- **Nacelle:** Fiberglass housing for generator and control systems.  
- **Braking and Control:** Hydraulic brake (HAB-4-90RS) and Radio Bridge sensor system for predictive maintenance.

### Calculations and Modeling
- Aerodynamic power derived from Betz’s limit (η ≈ 0.59).  
- Realistic efficiency target of 40%, yielding ~3.4 MW average effective power.  
- 3D modeling and assembly performed in **Autodesk Inventor**.  
- Detailed **Free Body Diagrams (FBDs)** and centroid/mass calculations for all structural parts.

### Deliverables
- Complete **engineering report** with design rationale, diagrams, and safety considerations.  
- **Drawings and assembly views** for tower, rotor, nacelle, shaft, and blades.  
- **Maintenance and operations manual** with predictive, preventive, and corrective maintenance planning.
