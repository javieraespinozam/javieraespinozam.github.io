# Gear Box Design — Technical Drawing

## Overview
This document presents a gearbox assembly designed and modeled in **Autodesk Inventor**, illustrating the mechanical layout, key dimensions, and assembly views for the transmission system.  
The PDF contains orthographic projections and section views used to validate clearances, gear alignment, and housing geometry.

## Contents
- Assembly Drawing: Exploded and assembled views of the gearbox  
- Component Dimensions: Detailed measurements for shafts, bearings, gears, and housing  
- Bill of Materials (BOM): Reference parts included in the mechanical system  
- Tolerances and Annotations: Machining and fit information aligned with standard manufacturing practices

## Design Objective
The gearbox is intended to **transmit mechanical power efficiently** between rotating shafts under variable load conditions.  
The design focuses on:
- Torque transmission efficiency  
- Compactness and ease of assembly  
- Material optimization for lightweight yet durable performance  
- Compatibility with standard gear module specifications

## Tools and Methods
- Software: Autodesk Inventor (modeling and drawing)
- File Format: PDF export of `.iam` / `.idw` mechanical assembly
- Analysis: Preliminary kinematic and structural verification using CAD parameters

## How to View
To explore the model interactively:
- Upload the `.iam` or `.ipt` files to [Autodesk Viewer](https://viewer.autodesk.com/)
- Or open with CAD-compatible software such as **Fusion 360**, **FreeCAD**, or **Solid Edge Viewer**
